# Employee Self-Service (ESS) AI Chatbot

A modern AI-powered Employee Self-Service chatbot system that uses natural language processing to understand employee queries and provide relevant information about HR policies, benefits, leave, attendance, and more.

## 🎯 Features

### Core Functionality
- **AI-Based Intent Detection** - Uses sentence transformers for semantic understanding
- **Entity Extraction** - Extracts dates, leave duration, and leave types from queries
- **Authentication** - Employee login with session management
- **Permission Control** - Private queries require authentication
- **Business Logic Handler** - Responds based on intent with actual employee data
- **Streamlit UI** - User-friendly chat interface

### Intents Supported

#### General Queries (No Login Required)
1. **Leave Policy** - Information about leave types and duration
2. **Company Holidays** - List of company holidays
3. **HR Contact** - HR phone and email information
4. **Company Info** - Company mission and background
5. **Benefits** - Employee benefits information

#### Employee-Specific Queries (Login Required)
1. **Leave Balance** - Check remaining leaves
2. **My Manager** - Find out your reporting manager
3. **My Department** - View your department
4. **My Attendance** - Check attendance record
5. **Apply for Leave** - Submit leave request
6. **Salary Info** - View salary details

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Create Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 2. Activate Virtual Environment
**Windows:**
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### 4. Run the Application
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The chatbot will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## 🔐 Demo Login Credentials

| Employee ID | Password | Name | Department |
|---|---|---|---|
| E001 | pass123 | Alice Johnson | Engineering |
| E002 | pass456 | Bob Smith | Engineering |
| E003 | pass789 | Carol White | HR |
| E004 | pass000 | David Brown | Management |
| E005 | pass111 | Emma Davis | Sales |

## 💬 Example Queries

### General Queries (No Login)
- "What is the leave policy?"
- "When are the company holidays?"
- "How do I contact HR?"
- "Tell me about the company"
- "What benefits are available?"

### Employee-Specific Queries (After Login)
- "How many leaves do I have?"
- "Who is my manager?"
- "What is my department?"
- "What is my attendance record?"
- "I want to apply for leave on January 15 for 3 days"
- "What is my salary?"

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. Intent Detection
- User query is encoded using sentence-transformers
- Similarity is computed with intent embeddings
- Best matching intent is selected

### 2. Entity Extraction
- spaCy NLP extracts named entities
- Regex patterns extract dates and leave duration
- Structured data is prepared for business logic

### 3. Permission Check
- If intent is private, authentication is verified
- Unauthenticated users get login prompt

### 4. Business Logic
- Handler processes intent with user data
- Fetches information from mock database
- Computes results (e.g., leave balance)

### 5. Response Generation
- Structured response is formatted
- Natural language message is returned
- Chat history is maintained

## 🔨 Customization

### Add New Intent
1. Add entry to `config/intents.json`
2. Add handler method to `src/business_logic.py`
3. Add case in `src/chatbot.py` handle_intent()

### Add New Employee
1. Edit `data/employees.json`
2. Add employee record with all required fields

### Modify Leave Policy
1. Edit `_handle_leave_policy()` in `src/business_logic.py`
2. Update policy details as needed

## 🧪 Testing

### Test without Streamlit
```python
from src.chatbot import ESSChatbot

chatbot = ESSChatbot()

# Test general query
response = chatbot.process_message("What is the leave policy?")
print(response)

# Test login and employee query
chatbot.auth_manager.login("E001", "pass123")
response = chatbot.process_message("How many leaves do I have?")
print(response)
```

## 📝 Commands

Available in chat:
- `/login <employee_id> <password>` - Login
- `/logout` - Logout
- `/status` - Check login status
- `/help` - Show help message

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### spaCy model not found
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### Streamlit not starting
